# CYiB-2.1
## The source code of the video game *Cover Yourself in Blood* made on the Unity 3D engine, my first publicly released video game. Released on February 7, 2021.

**If you wanna play it it's at: https://jordancup.itch.io/cover-yourself-in-blood**

This code will probably not be used since it's kinda spaghetti (I swear I improved since) but I wanted to make it open anyway for archive purposes.

I missed the one year anniversary by a long shot but I'm making it up for it 5 months later.
